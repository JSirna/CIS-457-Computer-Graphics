# CIS-457-Computer-Graphics
CSU Spring 2022 Computer Graphics  

## Assignment 0
**Instructions**  
*PART 2*: Write a sample Java program to say “Hello Spring 2022” that demonstrates the use of
formats in Printf and the use of string concatenation. Your program should use multiple
features of these functions and be unique.  
## Assignment 1  
**Instructions**  
2. Write a method that checks whether projection of point p lies on the closed segment AB. [5 points]  
3. Write a program that draws a square ABCD. The points A and B are arbitrarily specified by the user by clicking the mouse button. The orientation of the points A, B, C and D should be counter-clockwise. [5 points]  
4. Write a program that, for four points A, B, C and P, which a) Draws a triangle formed by ABC and a small cross showing the position of P b) Displays a line of text indicating which of the following three cases applies:
P lies:  
- Inside ABC
- Outside ABC
- On an edge of ABC.
The user will specify the four points by clicking. [4 points]  
5. The same as part 4, but, instead of displaying a line of text, the program computes the distances of P to the (infinite) lines AB, BC and CA, and draws the shortest possible line that connects P with the nearest of those three lines. [4 points]
